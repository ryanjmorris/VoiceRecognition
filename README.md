# Voice Recognition
This is a demonstration of how to use Googles Voice Recognition software. Remember, running this on a generic emulator will NOT work unless you have Google Voice Services installed, in which, does not come along in the stock version.
There are workarounds to get it to work on an Emulator, of which, probably isn't worth the time.
Instead, just plug in a device and debug using that to run the application.
If the device does not have Google Voice installed, you will be able to install it through this application for testing purposes.
Lastly, this is a VERY basic application tailored towards a video demonstrating how to use voice recognition.
